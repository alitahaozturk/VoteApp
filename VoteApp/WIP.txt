  # WORK ITEMS

  ## Security
  [ ] Bug: Everyone can do all actions with default controllers.
        Fix --> Only users who created polls can edit/delete them. users can't be edited. votes non editable.
		Admin mode? --> can have access to everything. might be needed for test.

  ## P1s
  [x] Data Model
  [x] Contollers/Views
  [ ] Administrator view
  [ ] Non-logged in view
  [ ] Issue: Different top bars on Home vs other pages. Why?

  ## P2 ideas

  - Use claims or similar mechanism to allow only certain users to vote.
    -- users can be allowed to vote by using one-time codes to join a poll, for example.
